# sem-scraper
Using Puppeteer via Node to look at competitor links using a starting profile page, then adding their URLs to a JSON file. This is a web scraping tool that was developed as a marketing tool. The web page this tool crawls provides links and view counts of URLs that cover similar marketing profiles as the inputted website. This app then goes through the links for each of these results, and outputs the website and viewcounts to a CSV file for analysis. This tool was used as a business solution for gathering leads to market for ad space and was used primarily to gather dossiers of educational websites.
